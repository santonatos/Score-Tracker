# Score-Tracker

This is an easy to use score tracker for two players.
To use:

1) download all files in the same local foler (or clone the project)
2) open the score keeper html file in a browser by clicking on it.
3) Use the buttons to set the winning score and every time a player wins, add 1 point for the specific player.

TODO List:
- add option to customize users
- add match history data with mongodb.
